# 🧑‍💻 Instructions for people AND LLMs

## 📁 Global Claude Configuration

This file serves as the main entry point for global Claude Code instructions. All Claude-related configuration files are organized in the `.claude.global/` directory:

- **GLOBAL.CLAUDE.md** - This file with imports to all instruction modules
- **instructions/** - Modular instruction files imported via `@instructions/filename.md`
- **commands/** - Custom slash commands available across all projects
- **hooks/** - Hook scripts for tool execution events
- **settings.json** - Global Claude Code configuration
- **shared/** - Shared resources and utilities

These files are symlinked to `~/.claude/` via dotbot configuration for version control and consistency across machines.

## 🎨 Visual Development

- Use Playwright MCP server when making visual changes to front-end to check your work
- Always validate visual changes with browser snapshots
- Test user interactions after implementing UI components

## 🧭 Guidance & Clarification

- Ask for clarification upfront when you need more direction on initial prompts
- Present clear options and wait for user choice when approach is ambiguous
- Request specific requirements when user requests are too broad

## 🚨 System Load & Background Task Safety

**CRITICAL:** Claude Code background tasks can fail with `spawn pgrep EAGAIN` during high system load, causing the entire session to crash.

### Automatic Protections in Place

This system has multi-layer protection against system overload:

1. **System Load Guard Hook** (`~/.claude/hooks/system-load-guard.sh`)
   - Blocks tool execution when load > 10.0 (critical)  
   - Warns when load > 5.0 during background tasks
   - Tests process spawning capability before execution
   - Logs all load-related decisions

2. **Resource-Conscious Session Tracking**
   - tmux status updates skip when load > 8.0
   - Background process spawning is load-aware
   - Process accumulation prevention

### Claude Code Usage Guidelines

**Before Background Tasks:**
- Check system load: `uptime`
- Wait if load > 5.0 before using `run_in_background: true`
- Use shorter timeouts for potentially problematic tests

**If You See `spawn pgrep EAGAIN`:**
1. **Immediately check load**: `uptime`
2. **Kill runaway processes**: `ps aux | head -20` then `kill -9 <PID>`
3. **Wait for load < 3.0** before retrying background tasks
4. **Use direct terminal commands** instead of Claude Code during high load periods

**Background Task Best Practices:**
- Keep background processes short (< 30 seconds)
- Use `timeout` wrapper: `timeout 60s npm test`
- Monitor with `uptime` before each background task
- Close unused Claude Code sessions (check `ps aux | grep claude`)

### Common Culprits
- **Runaway test suites** (vitest, jest hanging)
- **Multiple Claude Code sessions** (check with `ps aux | grep claude`)
- **High graphics load** (WindowServer > 30% CPU)
- **Development servers left running** (npm run dev processes)

### Emergency Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Check system load
uptime

# Find resource hogs
ps aux | head -20

# Kill runaway tests
pkill -f vitest
pkill -f jest

# Kill excess Claude sessions (keep only current)
ps aux | grep claude | grep -v $$ | awk '{print $2}' | head -5 | xargs kill

# Check improved load
uptime
```

The system load guard will automatically prevent operations during critical load periods, but monitoring system health proactively prevents issues.

## 🖥️ Server Environments

- When working on a "Linux typo3" remove server, note that it is:
  - Without a GUI
  - Without a browser
  - Behind an htaccess authentication
  - When using tools like Playwright, MCP, or other calls on Linux typo3, use the `BURRITODEV_HTACCESS_USER` and `BURRITODEV_HTACCESS_PW` environment variables to access the URLs
