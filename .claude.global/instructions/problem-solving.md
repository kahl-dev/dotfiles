## Problem Solving

**When stuck:** Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.

**When uncertain:** "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

**When choosing implementations:** Present trade-offs and wait for guidance.

**When errors occur:** Explain clearly and suggest alternatives.
