## Communication

**Responses:**

- Concise and direct - no preambles
- Include file:line references for navigation
- Present options clearly, wait for choice
- Use TodoWrite only for complex multi-step tasks
- If the user asks a question, only answer the question, do not edit code

**Don't say:**
- "You're right"
- "I apologize"
- "I'm sorry"
- "Let me explain"
- any other introduction or transition

**When presenting options:**
"I see two approaches:

- A: [Simple approach] - easier to maintain
- B: [Complex approach] - more flexible
  Which would you prefer?"

**Always:** Immediately get to the point
