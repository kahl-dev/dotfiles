## Efficiency Patterns

**Parallel Operations:**

- Run multiple searches/reads in single messages
- Batch git operations (status, diff, log)
- Group related file edits

**Tool Priority:**

- Use Task for complex searches across many files
- Direct tools (Grep/Glob) for specific operations
- Project scripts over generic commands

Remember: Focus on maintainable solutions. When uncertain, ask for guidance.
