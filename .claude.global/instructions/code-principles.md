## Code Principles

**Architecture:**

- Prefer boring solutions over clever abstractions
- Clear function names over magic
- Small, focused functions
- Explicit over implicit
- Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary

**Quality:**

- Code is read more than written - optimize for clarity
- Run linters/tests after every implementation
- Delete old code completely when replacing
- No deprecated functions or versioned names
