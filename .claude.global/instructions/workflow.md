## Core Workflow: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

**Start every feature with:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

1. **Research** - Understand existing patterns and architecture
2. **Plan** - Propose approach and verify with you
3. **Implement** - Build incrementally with validation
4. **Validate** - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests

## Development Partnership

We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.
