   - WebFetch the changelog from `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md` to discover new features and hidden patterns
   - Get current prompt engineering best practices from Anthropic's guides
   - Check for any deprecations or breaking changes

2. **Context7 Libraries**
   ```
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id "claude code prompts"
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id "prompt engineering"  
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id "anthropic prompt tutorial"
   ```
   - Extract all available documentation with maximum tokens
   - Focus on the 641-example interactive tutorial patterns

3. **GitHub Pattern Analysis**
   ```
   mcp__github__search_repositories "claude code commands"
   mcp__github__search_code "slash commands claude"
   ```

   - **Role Definition**: "You are an expert in [domain] with [specific expertise]..."
   - **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex workflows into clear steps
   - **Constraint Specification**: Explicit boundaries and limitations
   - **Output Formatting**: Structured response templates

2. **Advanced Techniques** (from the 641-example tutorial)
   - **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: "Let's think through this step by step..."
   - **Few-Shot Examples**: Providing concrete patterns to follow
   - **Prefill Guidance**: Starting assistant responses with structure
   - **XML/JSON Structuring**: For complex data handling

3. **Optimization Patterns** (from changelog discoveries)
   - Using new features from latest Claude Code versions
   - Implementing efficient token usage patterns
   - Leveraging new import syntax capabilities
   - Applying performance optimizations

4. **Security & Reliability** (best practices)
   - Input validation patterns
   - Injection prevention techniques
   - Safe default behaviors
   - Comprehensive error boundaries
   - Graceful degradation

#### Prompt Engineering Framework
