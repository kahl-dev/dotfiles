# üö® AGGRESSIVE CODE QUALITY CHECK

When the user runs `/check`, you will perform EXHAUSTIVE code quality checks and FIX EVERYTHING. This is not a reporting task - this is a FIXING task.

## YOUR MISSION

1. Run comprehensive checks for JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue files
2. Find EVERY issue - no matter how minor
3. Fix EVERYTHING immediately
4. Re-run checks until perfection is achieved
5. NEVER stop until all checks pass

## PACKAGE MANAGER DETECTION

FIRST, detect which package manager the project uses:
- Check for `yarn.lock` ‚Üí use `yarn`
- Check for `pnpm-lock.yaml` ‚Üí use `pnpm`  
- Check for `package-lock.json` ‚Üí use `npm`
- Check for `bun.lockb` ‚Üí use `bun`
- Default to `npm` if no lock file found

Use the detected package manager for ALL operations below.

## CHECKS TO PERFORM

### 1. ESLint (JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue)
- Run ESLint on ALL .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .vue, .mjs, .cjs files
- First attempt `eslint --fix` 
- For remaining issues, fix them manually
- NO WARNINGS ALLOWED - even style issues must be fixed

### 2. TypeScript Type Checking
- Run `tsc --noEmit` on all TypeScript files
- Run `vue-tsc --noEmit` on Vue files if available
- Fix EVERY type error
- Add proper types where missing
- Remove all `any` types unless absolutely necessary

### 3. Tests
- Run tests with detected package manager (`yarn test`, `pnpm test`, `npm test`, etc.)
- Fix all failing tests
- If no test script exists in package.json, suggest adding one:
  - "Consider adding tests with: `jest`, `vitest`, or `mocha`"
  - DO NOT install or create a test system
  - Just note it as a recommendation for later

### 4. Security Audit
- Run security audit with detected package manager:
  - `yarn audit` (yarn)
  - `pnpm audit` (pnpm)
  - `npm audit` (npm)
  - `bun audit` (bun)
- Fix ALL vulnerabilities:
  - `yarn upgrade --latest` or `yarn upgrade-interactive` (yarn)
  - `pnpm update` (pnpm)
  - `npm audit fix --force` (npm)
- Update packages as required
- NO vulnerabilities allowed

### 5. Build Verification
- Run build with detected package manager:
  - `yarn build` (yarn)
  - `pnpm build` (pnpm) 
  - `npm run build` (npm)
  - `bun run build` (bun)
- Fix any build errors
- Ensure build completes successfully

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

1. **Package Manager Detection**: FIRST check for lock files to determine package manager
2. **Initial Scan**: Run ALL checks in parallel using Task tool with detected package manager
3. **Create Fix Tasks**: Use TodoWrite to track every single issue found
4. **Aggressive Fixing**: 
   - Spawn multiple agents if needed
   - Fix issues in parallel where possible
   - Use Edit/MultiEdit aggressively
   - Use correct package manager for any installs/updates
5. **Verification**: Re-run ALL checks after fixes
6. **Repeat**: Continue until ZERO issues remain

## FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

‚ùå DO NOT just report issues
‚ùå DO NOT make excuses about why something can't be fixed
‚ùå DO NOT stop before everything is perfect
‚ùå DO NOT ignore warnings - treat them as errors
‚ùå DO NOT leave any TODO comments without implementing them

## EXAMPLE EXECUTION

```
üö® STARTING AGGRESSIVE CODE QUALITY CHECK

Running parallel checks...
[Use Task tool to run all checks simultaneously]

Found issues:
- 12 ESLint errors
- 8 TypeScript errors
- 3 failing tests
- 2 security vulnerabilities
- Build failing

Creating fix tasks...
[TodoWrite with all issues]

FIXING EVERYTHING NOW:
- Agent 1: Fixing ESLint errors...
- Agent 2: Resolving type errors...
- Agent 3: Fixing failing tests...
- Agent 4: Updating vulnerable packages...

[Continue aggressively until perfection]

‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSING - CODE IS NOW PERFECT
```

## REMEMBER

This is about achieving PERFECTION. Every semicolon, every type annotation, every style rule - EVERYTHING must be perfect. There are no acceptable compromises.

When in doubt, FIX IT. When it seems minor, FIX IT. When it's just a warning, FIX IT.

The only acceptable outcome is: ALL GREEN, ZERO ISSUES.
