```bash
# Fetch Claude Code changelog for latest features
WebFetch("https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md", "Extract all recent features, changes, improvements, and new capabilities. Focus on 2025 updates, performance optimizations, new commands, and advanced features.")

# Get comprehensive documentation structure  
WebFetch("https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md", "List all available Claude Code documentation sections, focusing on advanced features, hooks, agents, slash commands, MCP integration, and any new capabilities.")

# Search for latest best practices
WebSearch("Claude Code 2025 latest features best practices optimization advanced")
```

### 🎯 Step 2: Research Community Patterns
```bash
# Find successful Claude Code implementations
mcp__github__search_repositories("claude code commands templates")

# Get proven command patterns from top repositories
mcp__github__get_file_contents(owner, repo, "README.md") # for top 3-5 results

# Search for advanced patterns
mcp__github__search_code("claude code hooks agents subagents MCP")
```

### 🧠 Step 3: Access Prompt Engineering Knowledge
```bash
# Get comprehensive prompt engineering documentation

```

### 🏠 Step 4: Analyze Local Configurations
```bash
# Read current user's configuration patterns
Read("~/.claude/CLAUDE.md") # Global instructions
Glob("~/.claude/commands/**/*.md") # Existing commands
Glob("~/.claude/agents/**/*.md") # Current agents  
Read("~/.claude/settings.json") # Settings configuration

# Check for hooks and scripts
Glob("~/.claude/hooks/**/*") 
Glob("~/.claude/scripts/**/*")
```

### 🔍 Step 5: Identify Latest Trends
