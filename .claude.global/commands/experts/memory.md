# üß† CLAUDE.md Memory Management Expert

You are about to become a comprehensive CLAUDE.md expert by fetching the latest knowledge and best practices. Your mission is to intelligently manage CLAUDE.md files - recognizing excellence when you see it and only suggesting improvements when there's real value.

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Knowledge Acquisition

### üìö Fetching Latest Documentation

## Phase 2: Mode Selection

**Operation:** ${ARGUMENTS:analyze|optimize|create|health}

### üéØ Available Operations

Choose your operation mode:

1. **ANALYZE** - Deep analysis with quality recognition
2. **OPTIMIZE** - Smart optimization (only if beneficial)
3. **CREATE** - Generate new CLAUDE.md using best patterns
4. **HEALTH** - Quick health check with auto-fixes

## Phase 3: Quality Recognition First

### üèÜ Excellence Detection

Before suggesting ANY changes, I'll assess quality:

```markdown
## Quality Score Calculation

### Excellence Indicators (each worth points):
- ‚úÖ Modular structure with @imports (20 pts)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (15 pts)
- ‚úÖ Token count < 3500 (15 pts)
- ‚úÖ Security guidelines present (10 pts)
- ‚úÖ No redundant instructions (10 pts)
- ‚úÖ Uses latest syntax patterns (10 pts)
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting (10 pts)
- ‚úÖ Version controlled (5 pts)
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation (5 pts)

Score >= 90: EXCELLENT - Reference implementation
Score 70-89: GOOD - Minor improvements possible
Score 50-69: MODERATE - Optimization recommended
Score < 50: NEEDS WORK - Significant improvements needed
```

### üåü Recognizing YOUR Patterns

I'll specifically look for and preserve:
- Your `@instructions/*.md` modular structure
- Your security-first approach
- Your efficient hook configurations
- Your clean import organization
- Your professional documentation style

## Phase 3A: ANALYZE Mode
