### Modular Installation
```bash
# Install specific components only
./install-standalone tmux
./install-standalone neovim_build

# Install by profile
./install-profile liadev    # Development setup
./install-profile macos     # Complete macOS setup
```

#### 📝 Tab Completion
The dotfiles system includes intelligent tab completion for both installation scripts:

- `./install-profile <TAB>` - Shows available recipes: `liadev`, `macos`, `pi`
- `./install-standalone <TAB>` - Shows available ingredients: `tmux`, `neovim_build`, `claude`, etc.

Completion is automatically available after sourcing your zsh configuration and can be enabled for Bash by sourcing `completion/dotfiles-completion.bash`.

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
make help                   # Show all available commands
make updateShell           # Reload shell configuration
brewup                     # Update all brew packages and cleanup
brewdump                   # Export current packages to Brewfile
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Broken symlinks**  
Simply rerun your profile installation: `./install-profile macos`

**Shell configuration not loading**  
Run `make updateShell` or restart your terminal

**Homebrew package conflicts**  
Check system health with `brew doctor` and resolve any issues

**System Requirements:**
- macOS with Homebrew installed
- Git for submodule management  
- Node.js for Remote Bridge system

- **Performance First**: Optimized tools (100x faster grep/find) tuned for everyday workflows
- **Modular Design**: Mix and match components with ingredients/recipes system
- **Battle-Tested**: Daily-driven configuration with extensive documentation

Perfect for developers who work across local and remote environments and want a consistent, powerful terminal experience.
